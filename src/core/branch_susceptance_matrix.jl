    Mathematical notes:
    The branch susceptance matrix is M = B × Ab, where
        B = Diag(b) and Ab is the branch incidence matrix.
    
    Therefore, M and Ab have the same sparsity structure (2E non-zeros coeffs)
        and differ only in the absolute value of the numerical coeffs
        (+1 and -1 for Ab, +bₑ and -bₑ for M).

    As a consequence, much of the code is repeated boilerplate,
        and could (conceptually) be merged by representing Ab as a
        branch susceptance matrix where all branches have unit susceptance.
        This is left for future work
